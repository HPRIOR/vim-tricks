Buffers are areas of vim's memory used to hold text
--- file management ---

:new <filename> # create new file (new buffer horizontal)
:ls             # show all buffers 

;   # open buffer search (telescope )


--- window management --- 

# split 
# (can be supplied file name to create a new file in the buffer otherwise it will open current)

:split 
:vsplit

<C-w>           # preceeds many window commands
[-, +][<, >]    # resize window
[hjkl]          # window navigation
<C-[i, o]>      # jump back/forward locations
          
--- tabs ---
g[t, T]  # cycle through tabs


--- misc --- 
:noh    # no highlights

--- telescope bindings ---
#  access telescope built ins 
<Leader>pp      

#  most recently used files
<Leader>m 

#  find buffer
; 

#  find in current buffer
<Leader>/ 

#  bookmarks
<Leader>' 

#  git files
<Leader>f 

#  all files
<Leader>bfs 

#  ripgrep like grep through dir
<Leader>rg 

# when in buffer search 
<C-x>  # go to file selection as a split   
<C-v>  # go to file selection as a vsplit   
<C-t>  # go to a file in a new tab


--- LSP bindings ---

# go to definition
gd    

# go to declaration
gD    

# find references
gr    

# go to implementation
gi    <cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.implementation()<CR>

# hover dock
K     

# signature_help

:Delete         # Delete a buffer and the file on disk simultaneously.
:Unlink         # Like :Delete, but keeps the now empty buffer.
:Move           # Rename a buffer and the file on disk simultaneously.
:Rename         # Like :Move, but relative to the current file's containing directory.
:Chmod          # Change the permissions of the current file.
:Mkdir          # Create a directory, defaulting to the parent of the current file.
:Cfind          # Run find and load the results into the quickfix list.
:Clocate        # Run locate and load the results into the quickfix list.
:Lfind/Llocate  # Like above, but use the location list.
:Wall           # Write every open window. Handy for kicking off tools like guard.
:SudoWrite      # Write a privileged file with sudo.
:SudoEdit       # Edit a privileged file with sudo.
