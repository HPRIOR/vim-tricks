Buffers are areas of vim's memory used to hold text
--- file management ---

:new <filename> # create new file (new buffer horizontal)
:ls             # show all buffers 

;   # open buffer search (telescope )


--- window management --- 

# split 
# (can be supplied file name to create a new file in the buffer otherwise it will open current)

:split 
:vsplit

<C-w>           # preceeds many window commands
[-, +][<, >]    # resize window
[hjkl]          # window navigation
<C-[i, o]>      # jump back/forward locations
          
--- tabs ---
g[t, T]  # cycle through tabs


--- misc --- 
:noh    # no highlights
